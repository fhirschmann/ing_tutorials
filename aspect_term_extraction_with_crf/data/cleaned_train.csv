i took it back to best buy where they be so helpful and immediately gave me a new one,

if you have pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now,
2 weeks after giving the computer for repair -called headquarters,
they report that they have not looked at it yet but it be on the top of the stack ,
this machine delivers,

like opening my documents folder,opening my documents folder
the reality was,
i bought the netbook because it be smaller and lighter for me to carry around,
the genius at the apple store advised me that there be nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure,
we will save our money to replace it with a mac again,
thank you for your great product,
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they be certain things like this never happen,
i have always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that be never very intuitive,operating systems

with no inexpensive way of fixing it,
all the problems i have have with pc be solved with a mac ,

the other lock-up problems be from a myriad of causes,
