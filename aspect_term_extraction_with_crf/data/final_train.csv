like opening my documents folder,"BB,B,I,I,I"
the reality was,"O,O,O"
i bought the netbook because it be smaller and lighter for me to carry around,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

they cannot guarantee the problem will be solved if it be sent for service and i have to accept the outcome,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O"

so i can place it there,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
i burned my leg,"O,O,O,O"

overall though,"O,O"
so you do not get frustrated the first few weeks,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

for being so small it be amazing that it be as fast as it is,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but they be all way too pricey for the kind of economy the us be going through,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i like all mac computers,"O,O,O,O,O"
heck,O
then after paying for it to be examined i be told it be same problem cited on website but i would have to pay anyways since it be past warrenty,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
they claim that i should be happy because i be getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i be already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop have shown,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
the machine itself be alright,"O,O,O,O,O"
it seems to have some opions that be intalled but do not work like i thought they would,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and having to deal with the company have been a even worse nightmare,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O"
i will definitely be getting a new laptop if it have any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when i do so i do not run accross a situation like this again,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i also experience the same with my macbook air,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it have all the features that be necessary for college and if not they be able to be added onto the computer,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i have owned many different brands of laptops in my life,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i did an internet search and this be a very common problem with this laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
already the mouse button have broke,"O,BB,B,I,EI,O"
i have owned this labtop for less then two months,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
other than it poor performance,"O,O,O,BB,B"
overheating and occational blue screen,"O,O,O,O,O"
it did fairly well,"O,O,O,O"
so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,EB,BB,B,EB,O,O"
the touchpad be very intuitive,"BB,B,EB,O,O"
tons of bloatware and junk programs,"O,O,O,O,BB,B"
its sad because their commercials be great,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
lots of extra space but the keyboard be ridiculously small,"O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,B,EB,O,O"
but instead i got a refund and bought a mac,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
luckily,O
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
never been hacked,"O,O,O"
it so bad that i be thinking i only got half a battery or something,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O"
largest hard drive and windows 7,"BB,B,I,EI,B,I"
long battery life,"BB,B,I"
good keyboard,"BB,B"
i think it be seventy nine plus tax,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
take your money elsewhere,"O,O,O,O"
in summary,"O,O"
the processor be very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,B,EB,B"
my battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i do not cae how cheap it is,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i will never buy refurbished again,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
and looks great to boot,"O,O,O,BB,B"
it pretty much does everything we could ever need,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it be just slow slow slow,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
i doubt you would be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
bottom line,"O,O"
i be extremely pleased to make the change to mac,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
as a lifelong windows user,"O,O,BB,B,EB"
i went out and got myself an apple macbook pro,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
owing to these problems,"O,O,O,O"
which i be using with great satisfaction at this very moment,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
so,O
the macbook pro be extremely thin and light compared to those heavy windows laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
so this be great for me,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
this be the first macbook i have ever had,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the acer one compuer be a great computer,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
another problem,"O,O"
and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day i bought it,"O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
my computer have never got a virus,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the macbook be also made better,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
i would heartily recommend theapple 133 macbook pro notebook computer z0j80001 notebook for all your needs,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
if you be thinking of a laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
so,O
and i be operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
installed openoffice and firefox,"BB,B,EB,B"
i wiped nearly everything off of it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
although it did have great battery life when it did work,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O"
have poor performance,"O,BB,B"
overall i feel this netbook be poor quality,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
easy to use first laptop,"O,BB,B,EB,O"
i picked it out because it be inexpensive 400 and i thought it would be a good,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
my only problem be i can not reg the product key,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
the time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
pay attention to the specs if you want these options,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
mind-numbingly slow-then i found it can only be loaded with 2gb maximum ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
stupidly,O
it also does not have bluetooth,"O,O,O,O,BB,B"
sure it have the one touch keys but that be the best feature of the computer,"O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
i can do pretty much 75 of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
being a pc user my whole life,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
great battery life,"BB,B,I"
the real stand out on this computer be the feel of the keyboard and it speed,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,B"
low price,"BB,B"
the computer seemed a great deal-seemingly high-end specs for a low,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
at first,"O,O"
delivery be early too,"B,EB,O,O"
i have to send it back 3 times,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
during that time,"O,O,O"
this thing holds its own,"O,O,O,O,O"
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
love the stability of the mac software and operating system,"O,BB,B,EB,BB,B,I,EI,B,I"
and that probably explains why i have already have my sata controller go bad within a year of buying it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i left the place angrily,"O,O,O,O,O"
i my wife be also now the proud owner of a macbook as well,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i have have a toshiba laptop in the past,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,I,I,EI,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I"
asus said my net-book be working properly,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
very annoying,"O,O"
my main reason to convert be the imovie program,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
it have a faster processor and more ram,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,B"
entry-level laptop,"O,O"
this will fit the bill,"O,O,O,O,O"
if you need an affordable,"O,O,O,O,O"
so why not give you a better battery ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
laptops be usually used on the go,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro be worth every dollar,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i be not a big fan of the netbooks but this one be very well designed,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
it may take a little getting used to but you do not have to worry about viruses or other headaches,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles,"O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI"
high tech features,"O,BB,B"
would like more trendy,"O,O,O,O"
keyboard be great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable,"B,EB,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,EB,O,O"
but that not too bad,"O,O,O,O,O"
screen be a bit glossy,"B,EB,O,O,O"
received the product promptly and without any issues,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i can hardly ever take my hands off it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it be so great,"O,O,O,O"
i remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever i look at the small scratch that it have caused,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
so i be now on the second motherboard within 3 months,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
i got it back again and be told the motherboard have been replaced,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
but reasons we chose this apple computer,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
when compared to my 3 week old early 2011 edition there i barely experience any difference in performance 23 ghz v s 24 ghz ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O"
processor ,B
but dell,"O,O"
they say it could be the motherboard again,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB"
i upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and be amazed to find out that this computer be much slower then my old laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
2nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best be that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,EB,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
especially,O
love the speed,"O,BB,B"
it could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have ddr5 instead of ddr3,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,BB,B,I,EI,BB,B,EB,BB,B"
the versions of these programs on a mac be graphically and functionally superior,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
worked on and opened on both a pc and mac,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
not only be the versions of these programs able to be saved,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O"
by air sounds more like by truck to me,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
so far it have been five months since the last problem be fixed and i be praying it have finally stopped,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it outstanding too,"O,O,O"
and multiple at a time if you sowish,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
so i be disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area be a priority,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
a month later,"O,O,O"
we reinstall the os vista ,"O,O,BB,B,I"
but there be no guarentee,"O,O,O,O,O"
some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
it a lie,"O,O,O"
my real problem with it the statement of 7 hour battery life be not just mere exaggeration -,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O"
just chill and enjoy,"O,O,O,O"
the battery life be also relatively good,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O"
it be her first laptop and she be thrilled,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i should have sent it back to them then,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i definitely suggest getting an extended warranty,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
you will probably need it,"O,O,O,O,O"
if this would be your first mac purchase then i would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between mac and pc ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i have have it only 5 months and have have to send it away to be repaired twice,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this laptop leaves alot to be desired,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
very imformative,"O,O"
wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who be not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,B,EB,B"
i have found it very easy to use,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
and best of all i can run all the web programming software i need to use all at once without slowing me down,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i do not have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i do not have stupid pop up windows even when i have pop ups blocked ,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,BB,B,I,EI"
i bought this laptop so that the entire family have a computer in the living room,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this be starting off good,"O,O,O,O,O"
the large screen also helps when you be working in design based programs like adobe creative suite,"O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,B,I,I"
the only pro to this computer be it be under 600,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
-do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O"
moral of the story ,"O,O,O,O"
this be my first dell i heard their customer service be lacking and that they be working on improving it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

this causes my wrist to scrape up against it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
enough said,"O,O"
like the pixel sizes and whatnot,"O,BB,B,I,EI,O"
the screen size would change on it own,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O"
setting would change for some reason,"B,EB,O,O,O,O"

also,O
iphotos be an excellent program for storing and organizing photos,"B,EB,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but most recently owned a budget pc since it be what we could afford,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
we be occasional mac users before,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
called tech support and got the usual acer we do not support software but for we can help you i explained there be no software involved in booting,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,B"

the programs be great,"BB,B,EB,O"
in case it gets broken,"O,O,O,O,O"
or crashes etc,"O,O,O"
the only thing i did not learn in my research be the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection,"BB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i cannot say enough good for it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
comfterbale to use light easy to transport,"O,BB,B,EB,O,BB,B"
the computer itself be a good product but the repair depot stinks,"BB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI"
i thought the price be great for the specs,"O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,BB,B"
i be tired of going without my laptop every few weeks,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the only down fall be that it have no cd drive but i found that they be very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who be always looking for more space then they have,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the hard disk capacity really does not matter to me,"BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O"
so,O
just for a stupid cd,"O,O,O,O,O"
keys stick periodically and i havent have the laptop for 45 days yet,"B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and when it goes flat,"O,O,O,O,O"
it just dies like a pc,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
maybe worse and i loose all my open documents,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it crashes,"O,O"
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
everything from the design to the os be simple and to the point,"O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,B,EB,O,O,EB,BB,O"
i be now making a point to avoid their products and i hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
of course a different brand,"O,O,O,O,O"
i v spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook -,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers,"O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this just keeps having it hard drive replaced,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI"
yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
when you look at the specs on apple products in comparison to a dell or a hp,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
then i proceed to tell her that i checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it be not like that,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
then they have me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the only downfall be the volume control,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
there be something wrong with the product and lg did not take up the responsibility,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i be very happy with this laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this laptop be durable and it be easy to travel with,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i finally decided on this laptop because it be the right price for what i need it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
what a mistake,"O,O,O"
or buy a usb wireless card,"O,O,BB,B,I,I"
if internet connectivity be important i would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i have read online that some users be having sound problems,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB"

the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think i ll buy a pc next time,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but to be honest,"O,O,O,O"
but this must make it to graduation and beyond,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
three years be a decent life,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
then it ceased charging at all,"O,O,BB,B,EB,O"
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it be one very large heat sink,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
however i would highly suggest purchasing a stand however,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB"
i do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
= webcam be a bit laggy,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O"

they said my warrenty be up and hung up on me,"O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the computer continued to give me issues and in late june it completely died again and i tried to call acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O"
its still going,"O,O,O"
this computer be exceptionally thin for it screen size and processing power,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,B,I"

prior to this computer,"O,O,O,O"
and on two occasions,"O,O,O,O"
but the computer have locked up many times,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
maybe not,"O,O"
the screen have simply gone black,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O"
maybe this be virus related,"O,O,O,O,O"

using this machine be like a mild form of torture,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this wiped out several programs that be installed on the computer when it be bought,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i decided to go to dell website and update it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
on the twelfth day that i have the notebook,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the computer blinks it shuts off at will,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
excellent product for the money,"O,O,O,O,O"
easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i pondered very long over this decision,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this thing sucks,"O,O,O"
i love my new computer,"O,O,O,O,O"
let just start out by saying i be in no way a computer techy,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
okay,O
it be a waste of money from day one,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
just switched from years of pc frustration,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i be new ,"O,O,O"
so i got another netbook which i love,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but in fact it be totally the opposite,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the display be beyond horrible,"BB,B,EB,O,O"

there be hardly any memory on the computer hard drive,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,BB,B,I"
i have noticed the one on the sales floor also did not have sound,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B"

i started hainv problems with it within the first month,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
most acer laptop fans be on the bottom which be right on your laptop,"O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
next,O
the laptop preformed pretty well,"O,BB,B,EB,O"
it that hot,"O,O,O"
i be honestly afraid that it will burn me,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but i do not see it as a problem,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until i got the blue screen of death and have to send the pc back to hp,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i think this will happen to any new version of computer phone released and i need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i have have two toshiba satellite computers and while they be okay,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and be given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB"
unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
they be absolutely useless,"O,O,O,O"

his language be so bad i swore i be taking the turing test,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which be frustrating,"O,O,EI,B,I,EI,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O"
the battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we be sol there to,"BB,B,I,EI,BB,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,B,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and the only reason i did not purchase a mac be because my school website strongly recommended students purchase pcs,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i needed a new computer for graduate school have never owned a laptop before ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but it got slow due to an older operating system,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
i have have another mac,"O,O,O,O,O"
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but since they do not make windows xp drivers for the sound card in this machine,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,BB,B,I,EI,O,O"
i be stuck until windows 7 came out,"O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O"

i ts nice to have the higher-end laptops,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but,O
just a black screen,"O,O,BB,B"
all you have to do be turn it on and it works,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
a key contributor that led me to mac be the art aspect,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"

eventually my battery would not charge,"O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
recently there be a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
save your money and go for a better device,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but in my mid twenties i decided to convert to the dark side,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

accordingly,O
i ordered four d620 laptops,"O,O,O,O,O"

from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
hp be more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they be in helping or fixing,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

now the machine wo not connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now i be out of warranty even though this have been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,EB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
will certainly use macconnection again,"O,O,O,O,O"
and save yourself 100 than the other model with 8gb of ram,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I"
buy this model and just purchase 4gb of ram 2x2gb for 92 or 1x4gb for 99 ,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but,O
this be one of the reasons i purchased it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i went with an asus g73jh-x3,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
instead of taking another chance on toshiba,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it like that one,"O,O,O,O"
she told me flatly,"O,O,O,O"
you would be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
if you be looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
it be the easiest computer i have ever used,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
what did apple do for me ,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
so you might ask,"O,O,O,O"
also,O
be no problem for me when i used itunes which usually slows down my pc ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O"
browsing,B
should be there by the end of the week again ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and i be in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
decent comp for the price,"O,O,O,BB,B"
again,O
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

my llast computer be an acer,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
tosiba have a good reputation,"O,O,O,O,O"

so did my wife,"O,O,O,O"
my friend just have to replace his entire motherboard,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
and i be not kidding you,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
i called different hours of the day and you will get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
since they make it sound like they do not have your history list of your calls right in front of them,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another,"B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
quality display i be surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop,"B,I,EI,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,B,EB,O,O,O"
the battery life also does not keep up with the claim but still i think macbook be much ahead from the rest of the pack,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the internet capabilities be also very strong and picks up signals very easily,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
have high definition quality in the videos,"BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O"
its fast,"O,O"
they transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you be saying and you cannot understand what they be saying,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but good enough,"O,O,O"
speakers do not get that loud,"B,EB,O,O,O,O"
i have have it 9 months and it be already a 250 loss,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
another great thing be the beast graphics,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
i be wrong,"O,O,O"
the ease of set up be terrific,"O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O"
everything i have tried have worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery be so awesome,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,BB,B,EB,O,O"
but it a netbook,"O,O,O,O"
yes it small ,"O,O,O"
screen be crystal clear,"B,EB,O,O"
so this review might be a tad bit bias,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
maybe four years ago,"O,O,O,O"
this be around three years,"O,O,O,O,O"
the battery life be probably an hour at best,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O"
this be a review of windows vista system,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I"
she said its very user friendly,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
but i still love the laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
kind of annoying,"O,O,O"
the only thing they changed be 2 of the function keys at the top,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O"
cosmetically,O
well worth the extra money,"O,O,O,O,O"
i be very happy i bought this mac,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the bios again and shut down and would not turn back on,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
there literally no way to make it sing with vista,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
i decided on the macbook pro,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
after looking at all the pros and cons,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
screen size be perfect for portable use in any environment,"B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it does not have a push button to open the lid,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,BB,B"
first,O
