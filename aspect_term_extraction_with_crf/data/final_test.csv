i have just have to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
extremely disappointed with the way it is,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
never been happier using computer,"O,O,O,O,O"
i have have a total of 5 different laptop from many different manufactures,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
does everything i wanted this laptop to do,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
besides,O
turns out this be a common problem,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
starts up in a hurry and everything be ready to go,"B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it be also fast as can be you get what you pay for well worth the investment,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but i be still learning so cannot rate it yet for everything,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
thank you apple and amazon,"O,O,O,O,O"
overall very impressed,"O,O,O"
but it made from aluminum that scratches easily,"O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
that a good thing,"O,O,O,O"
yes,O
very fast for my needs,"O,O,O,O,O"
i bought this mac in order to replace my old dell laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
quick and have built in virus control,"O,O,BB,B,I,I,I"
took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O"
i saw the mini mac at best buy and decided to get this as my replacement,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i finally decided on this one and could not be any happier,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i be also informed that the components of the mac book be dirty,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,O,O,O,O"
so glad i did not waste money on a less than par product,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
have not regretted it one bit,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
the one thing that apple does right be computers,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i cannot wait till it completely dies in 3 years,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
tops,O
the hardware problems have been so bad,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
it so nice that the battery last so long and that this machine have the snow lion,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
i think that they be the best out on the market,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
however i chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
which leaves me to my next point,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
that quite a bump up from the 599 that this little guy sells for,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this be quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
my laptop be so light that i can take it with me anywhere,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and it have all the new features and whatnot,"EB,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O"
it exactly what i wanted,"O,O,O,O,O"
you can do absolutely anything and be very fast and stylish,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
finally decided to try a mac because there be too many choices of which pc to buy and everyone who have a mac said buy a mac ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a macbook ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
the keyboard be not very sensitive,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O"
it feels cheap,"O,O,O"
that defeated the whole point of a laptop,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and the sound quality isnt superb,"O,BB,B,I,EI,O"
though please note that sometimes it crashes,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it be very easy to navigate even for a novice,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O"
no complains at all,"O,O,O,O"
but until now,"O,O,O"
the cons be more annoyances that can be lived with,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
have a wonderful battery life and i could not be happier,"O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O"

the device speaks about it self,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
and windows 7 extensively,"BB,B,I,EI"
windows vista,"B,I"
i used windows xp,"O,BB,B,I"
the only thing that bums me out about this purchase be they released a newer updated mbp seriously right after i bought this one,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i did add a ssd drive and memory,"O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,B"
i got this one for thanks giving offer for 962 ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i have my pc laptop for 3 years and going to a macbook pro be like i leaped through time,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
on start up it asks endless questions just so itune can sell you more of their products,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O"
pretty much made sense to get a mini,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i have been a pc user for a very long time now but i will get used to this new os,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
not something you want to miss out on,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
also the charging cables be made of the same cheap material as the iphone ipod touch cables,"O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,BB,O,O,O,I"
this mac does not come with restore disks and i be not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer pc ,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

the machine be speedy and efficient,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
i think this be about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"

the ram memory be good but should have splurged for 8mb instead of 4mb,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and read different articles and debates,"O,O,O,O,O,O"

i love it and would recommend it to everyone who be tired of the constant attention pc require,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
i be a little worry at first because i do not have a lot of experience with osx and windows have always been second nature to me after many years of using windows,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"

i be an info sys major in college,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
it turned out to be pretty simple,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
solution ,O
with the softwares supporting the use of other os makes it much better,"O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O"

this one have a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient,"O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O"
i be considering buying the air,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
so built in screen size be not terribly important,"BB,B,I,I,I,EI,O,O,O"
at home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 lcd screen,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,I"
hopefully my replacement be brand new,"O,O,O,O,O,O"

portable laptop to my writing and be surprised to learn that i needed to buy a word processing program to do so,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O"
i bought it to be able to dedicate a small,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
not the latest fourth-generation haswell cpu the 2013 version has,"O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O"
this version of macbook pro runs on a third-generation cpu ivy bridge ,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,I"
i think i be intimidated by the change from a pc,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i be the pro-active type so i went off and did some preventative fixes,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
and its not hard to accidentally bang it against something so i recommend getting a case to protect it,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O"
i wanted to explore what the mac be all about,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

every time i log into the system after a few hours,"O,O,BB,B,I,I,I,EI,O,O,O"
the majority of the reviews seem to be for the 133 macbook pro model md101ll a,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
this set up be silky smooth,"BB,B,I,EI,O,O"
put a ssd and use a 21 led screen,"O,BB,B,EB,O,BB,B,I,I"
i saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from apple and i be concerned but i took my chances and be overly impressed,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size,"O,O,O,O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,BB,B"
the case be now slightly larger than the previous generation,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
as i be old school and hate the pad,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B"
as i be used to a bigger one and pounding,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i be really happy because it be a much better price on amazoncom than it be in the mac store,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

i be paying apple to kill my self and my wallet,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
no star for this trash ,"O,O,O,O,O"
i will upgrade the ram myself because with this model you can you can do it later on,"O,BB,B,I,I,EI,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
the price be 200 dollars down,"BB,B,EB,O,O,O"

this mac mini does not have a built-in mic,"O,O,O,O,O,O,BB,B,I"
a lot of features and shortcuts on the mbp that i be never exposed to on a normal pc,"O,O,BB,B,EB,B,EB,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
